# Cassette Demos
Cassette Demos is a basic html5 recorder, letting you track right in the browser. Tap the recording button to start and again to stop. Playback and seek through the track, edit the demo name and download to your computer.

This is a chrome experiment and was developed to work only in the Google Chrome browser. It uses some technologies not yet fully supported across all browsers.
